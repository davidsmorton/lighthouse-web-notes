### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators(`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using `node` command in Vagrant. 

Work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use `hunger` and `availiableTime` insode your function, try outputting their values to the Termianl as follows. 

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime){
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
